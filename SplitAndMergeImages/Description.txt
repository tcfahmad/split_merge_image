DESCRIPTION:
SplitAndMergeImages is a Console Apllication which splits an image in n(>15) number of images and then merges them back together to form the original image.



ASSUMPTIONS:
1) Only dividing along the width will suffice. This restricts the splitCount to max of width of image. (Please revert if complete n x m split is required)
2) We are only dealing with .jpg format as of now just to streamline the process. Methods can be extended to cover other formats too.
3) Since we cannot always have split images of equal dimensions, the split method adds the left over part of the image to the last image if splitCOunt is not a factor of the width of original image.




INPUTS:
URL: The url of the original image. If this is not provided, URL will default to "https://images.pexels.com/photos/226589/pexels-photo-226589.jpeg"

splitCOunt: count in which the original image need to be divided(0 to <= image.width)

User has an option to select whether to go for remerge or not once the split is complete by giving 1 as an input to remerge and any other character to complete




OUTPUTS:
The Split Images are placed at following path:
C:\Split&MergeOutput\SplitImages

The ReMerged image is placed at following path:
C:\Split&MergeOutput\MergedImage
